// Leetcode Question Number:1816 (Truncate Sentence)

// Question
// A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each of the words consists of only uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation).

// For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", and "hello world hello world" are all sentences.
// You are given a sentence s​​​​​​ and an integer k​​​​​​. You want to truncate s​​​​​​ such that it contains only the first k​​​​​​ words. Return s​​​​​​ after truncating it.

// Sample Test Case 

// Input: s = "Hello how are you Contestant", k = 4
// Output: "Hello how are you"
// Explanation:
// The words in s are ["Hello", "how" "are", "you", "Contestant"].
// The first 4 words are ["Hello", "how", "are", "you"].
// Hence, you should return "Hello how are you".


var truncateSentence = function(s, k) {
  let str = s.split(" ").slice(0,k)
  return str.join(" ")
};

console.log(truncateSentence( "What is the solution to this problem", 4))
